    - Evaluate market size and dynamics in key regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia).
    - Identify regional trends, regulatory factors, and customer differences.
    - Determine priority geographies and expansion opportunities.

    **DELIVERABLES:**
    After the research phases, include deliverables:
    - **`[DELIVERABLE]`**: A comprehensive Market Analysis Report
    - **`[DELIVERABLE]`**: Executive summary highlighting key market metrics
    - **`[DELIVERABLE]`**: Supplementary data sources and calculation rationale

    **SEARCH STRATEGY INTEGRATION:**
    Your plan should implicitly guide the researcher to use search patterns such as:
    - "[Market category] market size forecast", "[Market category] TAM [year]"
    - "[Product category] competitors list", "[Market category] key players"
    - "[Industry] value chain analysis", "[Industry] regulatory overview"
    - "[Technology] adoption statistics", "[Region] [industry] market size"
    
    **TOOL USE:**
