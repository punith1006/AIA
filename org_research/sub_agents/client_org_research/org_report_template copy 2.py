    ### HTML TEMPLATE COMPLIANCE

    **CRITICAL:** You must use the EXACT HTML structure provided above. Do not modify the HTML structure, CSS, or JavaScript. Only replace the bracketed placeholders with actual data.

    **1. Template Sections to Fill:**
    - Replace [[ORGANIZATION_NAME]] with actual organization name
    - Replace [[REPORT_TITLE]] with generated report title
    - Replace [[DATE]] with current date: {datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%B %d, %Y")}

    - Populate tables with actual data rows
    - Update metric values and organizational data

    **2. Data Population Rules:**
    - **Tables:** Add actual data rows inside <tbody> sections, removing placeholder rows when necessary
    - **Metrics:** Update metric values with actual organizational figures
    - **Executive Cards:** Create cards for each key executive with real background information
    - **Data Grids:** Fill data cards with specific organizational metrics and information
    - **Finding Cards:** Use appropriate CSS classes (critical, opportunity, warning) based on analysis
    - **Risk Cards:** Apply correct risk level classes (high-risk, medium-risk, low-risk)

    **3. Missing Data Handling:**
    - If specific data is not found, explicitly state "Information not available in research"
    - Do not leave bracketed placeholders unfilled
    - For missing metrics, use "N/A" or state "Data not found"
    - For missing sections, include a note explaining the limitation
